Summary Report: Random Forest Model & Data Preparation

Purpose:
To build and evaluate a Random Forest classification model using prepared input datasets with a focus on:
- Addressing class imbalance
- Merging external features
- Evaluating model performance with a confusion matrix and metrics
- Creating a final merged report for assessment

1. Data Preparation

Input Files:
- apr_filter.csv — Main dataset
- gl_april_filter.csv — Lookup table with additional fields

Key Steps:
- Read both datasets.
- Merged the datasets using 'Con' and date fields.
- Standardized column names by converting to lowercase and removing underscores (except for 'Con').
- Handled class imbalance using downsampling of the majority class by a specified factor.

2. Model Training

Libraries Used:
- scikit-learn (Random Forest, metrics, train-test split)
- imblearn (SMOTE for handling class imbalance)

Preprocessing:
- Encoded categorical columns.
- Split dataset into training and testing sets (80:20 split).
- Optionally applied SMOTE for oversampling the minority class.

Model Training:
- Trained a Random Forest classifier with 100 estimators and a fixed random seed for reproducibility.

3. Model Evaluation

Predictions:
- Generated predictions on the test set.

Confusion Matrix:
- Created a 2x2 matrix showing true/false positives and negatives.

Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Classification Report:
- Detailed performance breakdown for each class.

4. Merged Evaluation Logic

- For multiple model iterations, individual confusion matrices were summed.
- Final confusion matrix and metrics were calculated from the aggregated matrix.

Optional Add-ons

Feature Importance:
- Extracted and ranked the most important features influencing the model.

Save Results:
- Stored metrics, confusion matrices, feature importance, and predictions into structured outputs like Excel or CSV.

Learnings

- Downsampling and SMOTE are effective techniques to handle class imbalance.
- Random Forest is robust to overfitting and gives interpretable feature importance.
- Lookup table merges enrich the dataset and improve model quality.
- Using aggregated evaluation across runs provides a more reliable view of model performance.
